# Design System

> Status: **Draft v0.2.** Direction: clean & neutral.
> Decided: shadcn/ui components restyled with **plain CSS files** (one `.css` per component, no Tailwind, no styles in TSX), design tokens as CSS custom properties in `src/styles/tokens.css`, mobile-first, PWA conventions. See CODE_STYLE.md §5a.
> Values marked *Proposed* are sensible defaults (shadcn's "neutral" theme) that can be replaced once the brand look is chosen.

## 0. Styling Architecture

```text
src/styles/tokens.css   → all design tokens (the only place raw values live)
src/styles/base.css     → reset, html/body, headings, focus defaults
src/styles/index.css    → @import tokens + base; imported once in main.tsx
<component>.css         → styles for exactly one component, imported by its .tsx
```
Component variants use `data-*` attributes (e.g., `data-variant`, `data-size`, `data-state` from Radix), never class maps in TSX.

## 1. Design Direction

Style:
**Clean & neutral.** A minimal, modern utility app.

Mood:
Calm, precise, uncluttered. Like a well-organized paint rack: the colors are the decoration, the interface stays quiet.

Design Principles:
- **Paint is the hero.** UI chrome stays neutral (grays) so swatch colors read accurately and aren't distorted by nearby brand colors.
- **One-handed mobile use.** Primary actions sit in the bottom half of the screen.
- **Fast over fancy.** Instant search, minimal animation, no blocking spinners for local data.
- **Honest color.** Always note that on-screen swatches are approximations.

---

## 2. Brand

Brand Name:
**TBD** (see PRD open questions)

Logo:
**TBD**, awaiting artwork (GitHub issue #3). Needs a square app icon (192px, 512px, 512px maskable, 180px apple-touch-icon). The PWA shipped without icons: until they exist, Chrome won't offer install and iOS uses a page screenshot.

Brand Voice:
Friendly and concise; standard paint terms only (base, layer, shade, contrast). Short labels, no exclamation marks.

---

## 3. Color Palette

Based on the shadcn "neutral" theme, defined as CSS custom properties in `src/styles/tokens.css` (`--color-primary`, `--color-background`, …; dark values under `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`):

| Token | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | `#171717` | `#FAFAFA` |
| Secondary | `#F5F5F5` | `#262626` |
| Background | `#FFFFFF` | `#0A0A0A` |
| Surface (card) | `#FFFFFF` | `#171717` |
| Text | `#0A0A0A` | `#FAFAFA` |
| Muted Text | `#737373` | `#A3A3A3` |
| Border | `#E5E5E5` | `#262626` |
| Input border | `#8A8A8A` | `#666666` |
| Swatch edge | `rgb(0 0 0 / 10%)` | `rgb(255 255 255 / 10%)` |
| Overlay (sheet backdrop) | `rgb(0 0 0 / 50%)` | `rgb(0 0 0 / 70%)` |
| Swatch ink (dark / light) | `#0A0A0A` / `#FAFAFA` | same: follows the paint, not the theme |
| Success | `#16A34A` | `#22C55E` |
| Warning | `#D97706` | `#F59E0B` |
| Error | `#DC2626` | `#EF4444` |
| Accent (brand) | none: Primary is the accent | none |
| Primary foreground *(Proposed)* | `#FAFAFA` | `#171717` |
| Primary hover *(Proposed)* | Primary mixed 90% with Background | same |
| Secondary hover *(Proposed)* | Secondary mixed 80% with Background | same |
| Focus ring *(Proposed)* | `#737373` | `#A3A3A3` |
| Error foreground *(Proposed)* | `#FFFFFF` | `#0A0A0A` |

Token names: `--color-primary`, `--color-primary-foreground`, `--color-primary-hover`, `--color-secondary`, `--color-secondary-hover`, `--color-background`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text`, `--color-muted-text`, `--color-border`, `--color-input-border`, `--color-swatch-edge`, `--color-swatch-ink-dark`, `--color-swatch-ink-light`, `--color-ring`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-error-foreground`.

Contrast notes (WCAG 2.1 AA):
- The light focus ring is `#737373` (4.74:1 on white), not shadcn's `#A3A3A3` (2.52:1, under the 3:1 non-text minimum in SC 1.4.11).
- Error foreground is near-black in dark mode: white on `#EF4444` is 3.76:1, under 4.5:1 for text.
- **Open:** Muted Text on Secondary is 4.35:1, under 4.5:1. Don't put muted text on Secondary surfaces until this is resolved.
- Border on Background is 1.26:1, so `--color-border` is decorative only (cards, dividers, the nav bar). Form controls use `--color-input-border`: `#8A8A8A` is 3.45:1 on Background and 3.17:1 on Secondary; `#666666` is 3.45:1 on Background and 3.12:1 on Surface (SC 1.4.11, DECISIONS 019).

Rules:
- No brand accent hue. Interactive emphasis uses Primary (near-black / near-white), so no UI color competes with paint swatches.
- Status colors (success/warning/error) are only used for status, never decoration.
- Only use tokens (`var(--color-primary)`, `var(--color-muted-text)`…), never raw hex in component CSS. Paint swatches get the paint's hex through the `--swatch-color` custom property set on the element; `paint-swatch.css` uses `background: var(--swatch-color)`.
- Dark mode: follows system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`) in MVP; a manual toggle is in ROADMAP NEXT.
- `theme-color` meta tag matches Background.

## 4. Typography

Font Family:
System font stack (no web-font download; good for offline and speed)
`ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`

Heading Font:
Same as body (no display font; keeps the clean look and works offline)

| Style | Size / Weight / Line Height |
|---|---|
| H1 | 24px / 700 / 32px |
| H2 | 20px / 600 / 28px |
| H3 | 16px / 600 / 24px |
| Body | 16px / 400 / 24px (inputs must be ≥16px to prevent iOS zoom) |
| Small | 13px / 400 / 18px |

Token names *(Proposed)*: `--font-sans`; `--text-h1|h2|h3|body|small`; `--leading-h1|h2|h3|body|small`; `--weight-regular|semibold|bold`.

---

## 5. Spacing

Base Unit: 4px
Tokens: `--space-1` (4px), `--space-2` (8px), `--space-3` (12px), `--space-4` (16px), `--space-6` (24px), `--space-8` (32px), `--space-12` (48px), `--space-16` (64px), `--space-24` (96px)
Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96px
Page horizontal padding on mobile: 16px

---

## 6. Border Radius

Tokens: `--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, `--radius-lg`, `--radius-pill`
- Small: 6px (badges)
- Medium: 8px (inputs, buttons)
- Large: 12px (cards, sheets)
- Pill: 9999px (chips, filter toggles)
- Swatch: rounded square, `--radius-md`. Circles are reserved for hue dots, so a filter never looks like a paint (DECISIONS 020)

---

## 6a. Sizing, Layering and Motion *(Proposed)*

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--border-width` | 1px | all borders |
| `--focus-ring-width` / `--focus-ring-offset` | 2px / 2px | global `:focus-visible` in `base.css` |
| `--touch-target` / `--touch-target-sm` | 44px / 36px | control heights (see §8) |
| `--header-height` / `--tab-bar-height` | 56px / 56px | app shell |
| `--swatch-size` / `--row-min-height` | 40px / 56px | paint rows (§10) |
| `--icon-size-sm` | 14px | swatch type marker, chip icons |
| `--content-max-width` | 1024px | centered content on wide screens (§14) |
| `--z-header` / `--z-tab-bar` / `--z-sheet` / `--z-toast` | 10 / 20 / 50 / 100 | stacking order; the nav bar sits above the sticky header it overlaps on tablet and desktop |
| `--duration-fast` / `--easing-standard` | 150ms / ease-out | hover and state transitions |
| `--opacity-disabled` | 0.5 | disabled controls |

---

## 7. Shadows

- Small `--shadow-sm`: cards at rest (`0 1px 2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05)`)
- Medium `--shadow-md`: popovers, dropdowns (`0 4px 6px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)`)
- Large `--shadow-lg`: bottom sheets, dialogs (`0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)`)
In dark mode, rely on borders rather than shadows.

---

## 8. Buttons

Use shadcn `<Button>` variants only.
- Primary: `default` variant. One per screen at most.
- Secondary: `secondary` or `outline`
- Danger: `destructive` (e.g., Delete account)
- Disabled: built-in disabled styles; keep the label visible
- Loading: show a spinner icon and keep the button width; disable while pending
- Minimum touch target: 44×44px (`--touch-target`). Exception: the `sm` size (36px, `--touch-target-sm`) is allowed for secondary controls only.

Own/Want/Favorite toggles: 44px circular icon buttons, `--space-2` apart, Own = `Plus`, Want = `Bookmark`, Favorite = `Heart` (DECISIONS 034), with `aria-pressed` and names like "Mark Mephiston Red as owned" / "… as wanted" / "… as favorite". No tooltips or visible labels. Off: outlined in `--color-input-border` (3:1). On: filled with Primary, icon in Primary foreground (the bookmark and heart themselves also fill). They're always siblings of a row's link, never inside it.

---

## 9. Inputs

Use shadcn `<Input>` and `<Select>`. Search uses `<Input type="search">` with suggestion chips below it, not `<Command>`.
- Default: `--color-input-border`, 16px text at every width (shadcn's desktop 14px is dropped)
- Focus: visible ring (`outline: 2px solid var(--color-ring)` on `:focus-visible`)
- Error: destructive border plus a message below
- Disabled: reduced opacity, `cursor-not-allowed`
- Placeholder: muted text. The search box placeholder reads "Search 2,000+ paints…" (live count)

---

## 10. Cards

- Padding `--space-3`–`--space-4`, `1px solid var(--color-border)`, `--radius-lg`, `--shadow-sm`
- **Paint row (list item):** swatch (40px) · name (bold) · brand · line/type (muted) · Own/Want toggles on the right. Row height ≥ 56px.
- **Paint detail:**
  - Hero swatch: full width, `--swatch-hero-height` (160px), `--radius-lg`, type marker at 24px, with "Colors are approximate." under it.
  - Facts: name as the page's only `<h1>`; "Brand · Line · Type · Finish" (muted); Discontinued badge; "Also known as …".
  - Hex: an outlined button named "Copy hex #…" that announces "Copied #…" in a status region.
  - Equivalents (`<h2>`): a "Show all types" checkbox and the family note for metallic, wash and tint paints. Then an `<h3>` per brand with up to 3 linked rows and match labels. A brand with no close match is muted (`--opacity-muted`) under "No close match in [Brand]".
- **Paint row:** the whole row links to its detail and keeps a ≥ 56px height and an inset focus ring

### Hue dots
A horizontal, scrollable row of 13 small circles (12 hues + neutral) under the empty search box. Each has a text label below it (don't rely on color alone).

### Search chips
Detected brand / hue / hex appear as removable pill chips under the search box (`Brand: Vallejo ×`); the whole chip is the button, named "Remove Brand: Vallejo". Suggestion chips (outlined) complete a partly typed brand or hue.

### Swatch component (`<PaintSwatch>`)
- Background = paint hex
- Rounded square, `--swatch-size` in rows, `--space-12` for the hex search preview
- 1px inner edge, `--color-swatch-edge`, so pale and dark paints stay visible on any background
- Ink on top of a swatch (the type marker) is black or white by WCAG relative luminance, switching at 0.18
- Metallic (sparkles), wash/shade/ink (droplet) and contrast/speedpaint (layers) get a small corner marker, since hex can't represent them. The swatch is decorative (`aria-hidden`); the type is always in the row text

### Paint row (`<PaintRow>`)
- Swatch · name (semibold) · "Brand · Line · Type" (muted) · match label or "Discontinued" on the right
- Own/Want toggles sit to the right of the row's link (`actions` slot); owned equivalents add "You own this" under the meta line

---

## 11. Navigation

Header:
Compact top bar with the screen title and a contextual action (e.g., filter button). Respect `env(safe-area-inset-top)`. Detail screens show a back button instead of a title (`staticData.back`): chevron plus the parent's name, named "Back to Paints". It goes back when the previous history entry is in the app, otherwise it opens the parent. Installed iOS apps have no browser back button, so this is the only way back there.

Navigation bar:
One floating nav bar on every screen and every breakpoint, with three destinations:
1. **Paints** (catalog + smart search: name, hex, brand, hue)
2. **My Paints** (owned / wishlist)
3. **Settings** (account, theme, about)

Position by breakpoint (§14):
- Mobile (< 640px): fixed to the bottom of the screen, inset `--space-3` from the left, right and bottom edges, plus `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`. Spans the width between the insets.
- Tablet and desktop (≥ 640px): fixed to the top of the screen, inset `--space-3` from the top edge plus `env(safe-area-inset-top)`. Centered, sized to its content, never wider than `--content-max-width`. The screen header sits below it.

Look:
- "Floating" means detached from the screen edges: Surface background, `1px solid var(--color-border)`, `--shadow-md` (border only in dark mode, per §7), `--radius-pill` *(Proposed)*.
- Height `--tab-bar-height`. Each item shows a 24px icon (`--icon-size-tab`) and a visible text label; items are at least 44×44px.
- Active item: `aria-current="page"` and a filled pill: `--color-primary` background, `--radius-pill`, icon and label in `--color-primary-foreground`. Inactive items: `--color-muted-text` on the bar, no background. The active style is keyed on `[aria-current="page"]`, not a router class or data attribute, so the look and the announced state can't disagree.
- Focus ring: drawn outside the item with the global positive offset, on the Surface. On the pill the dark-mode ring (`#A3A3A3` on `#FAFAFA`) is about 2.4:1, under 3:1. The bar's `--space-1` padding leaves room for the ring.
- Contrast (SC 1.4.11, 1.4.3): pill vs. Surface 17.9:1 light / 17.2:1 dark; label on pill 17.2:1; inactive label 4.74:1 light / 7.11:1 dark. Don't use a Secondary background as the marker (1.09:1 on Surface).
- Fallback if the filled pill competes with swatches: an outline pill (Primary border, no fill, Primary text), which still passes 3:1.

Behavior:
- Page content is never hidden behind the bar. On mobile, `main` is padded at the bottom by the bar height, its inset and the bottom safe-area inset. On tablet and desktop, the sticky header grows its top padding by the strip the bar floats in (top safe-area inset, inset, bar height, inset), so its background covers that strip and content never scrolls past above the header.
- The bar is a `<nav aria-label="Main">` that comes before `<main>` in the DOM at every breakpoint, so keyboard focus order matches the desktop layout. Moving it to the bottom on mobile is CSS only.
- No show/hide on scroll in MVP *(Proposed)*.

Sidebar:
None at any breakpoint.

Segmented control (My Paints):
Two links in a Secondary pill track inside a `nav` named "Collection"; the active one is the same Primary-filled pill as the nav bar's current item, with `aria-current="page"`. Each is at least 44px tall and shows its count as text ("Owned (2)").

Filters open in a bottom sheet: shadcn `Sheet` (`side="bottom"`) on Radix Dialog, not the vaul-based `Drawer` (DECISIONS 023). It's a modal dialog: focus trap, Escape, focus returns to the trigger. There's no swipe-to-dismiss. Max height `--sheet-max-height`, `--radius-lg` top corners, `--color-overlay` backdrop, a scrolling body with header and footer fixed, and bottom safe-area padding. The sheet edits a draft; the primary "Show N paints" commits it, and any other close discards it.

Sheet options (Show only, brand, line, type) are outline-button boxes: `--touch-target` tall, `--space-4` side padding, `--radius-md`, a `--color-input-border` edge, `--space-2` apart, the whole box is the hit area. The native checkbox or radio stays visible inside as the non-color checked cue; checked adds a Primary edge and Secondary fill, and the focus ring wraps the whole box. Hue dots keep their own style.

---

## 12. States

Loading:
Skeleton rows for Convex data: `--row-min-height` blocks in Secondary with `--radius-md`, `aria-hidden`, plus a visible "Loading …" status line. The catalog loads from cache and should be instant; on first visit show a single progress state ("Downloading paint catalog…").

Empty:
Icon, one-line explanation and a primary action. Examples: "No paints match" → Clear all (clears the search box and every filter). "You haven't added any paints yet" → Browse paints.

Error:
Inline message with Retry; a small in-app toast for failed saves (DECISIONS 029): Primary card above the nav bar, `--z-toast`, a 44px Dismiss button, auto-hides after 6 s, in an always-mounted `status` region so it's announced.

Success:
Optimistic UI; no toast for routine toggles.

Disabled:
Own/Want toggles when signed out still render; tapping them opens the app-wide sign-in sheet and the tap is applied after sign-in (DECISIONS 030). Offline and signed out, a tap shows the toast "Signing in needs an internet connection."

Offline:
Small "Offline" pill at the right of the header: Secondary background, `--color-input-border` edge, semibold small text. It's a live `status` region that's always present (empty while online), so the change is announced.

Update available:
A bar fixed above the nav bar on phones (bottom edge from 640px), `--z-toast`. It reads "Update available" with "Later" (ghost) and "Reload" (primary) buttons at full 44px height. "Later" hides it for the session.

Install hint:
A bordered card at the top of the page content, region "Install Grimify", with "Not now" (ghost) and, on Chrome, "Install app" (primary). On iOS it reads "Tap Share [share icon], then Add to Home Screen." It never covers the nav.

---

## 13. Icons

Icon Library: lucide-react (shadcn default)
Default Size: 20px (24px in the tab bar); tokens `--icon-size`, `--icon-size-tab`
Icon Style: Outline (stroke 2); filled variant only for active toggles

---

## 14. Responsive Design

Mobile (default): single column, floating nav bar at the bottom (§11)
Tablet: two-column list/detail where useful; floating nav bar at the top
Desktop: max content width ~1024px, centered; floating nav bar at the top

Breakpoints (use in `@media` queries in component CSS; CSS custom properties can't be used in media queries, so use these literal values):
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640–1023px
- Desktop: ≥ 1024px

PWA specifics:
- `viewport-fit=cover`; pad with `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
- Disable pull-to-refresh bounce on the app shell where it interferes
- No hover-only interactions

---

## 15. Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast for text (swatch labels auto-pick black or white)
- Support keyboard navigation (desktop)
- Provide visible focus states
- Provide accessible labels (`aria-label="Mark Mephiston Red as owned"`)
- Do not rely only on color: every swatch shows the paint name; match quality has a text label
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
