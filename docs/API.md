# API Documentation

> Status: **Draft v0.2**
> The app has no REST API. The "API" is (1) the static catalog file and (2) Convex functions called through the typed Convex client (`useQuery` / `useMutation`).

## 1. Static Catalog

### GET /catalog.json

Authentication:
None (public)

Caching:
Service worker: stale-while-revalidate. CDN: long cache with a content-hash query string (`/catalog.json?v=<hash>`).

Response:
```json
{
  "version": "a1b2c3d4",
  "brands":   [{ "id": "citadel", "name": "Citadel", "manufacturer": "Games Workshop" }],
  "lines":    [{ "id": "citadel-base", "brandId": "citadel", "name": "Base" }],
  "paints": [
    {
      "id": "citadel-base-mephiston-red",
      "brandId": "citadel",
      "lineId": "citadel-base",
      "name": "Mephiston Red",
      "hex": "#9A1115",
      "lab": [31.2, 50.1, 33.4],
      "hue": "red",
      "value": "dark",
      "type": "base",
      "finish": "matte"
    }
  ]
}
```
(Example values are illustrative. The schema is in DATABASE.md §3.)

## 2. Convex Functions

All functions live in `convex/`. Every function except where noted calls `requireUser(ctx)`, which throws `UNAUTHENTICATED` if there's no identity.

### users.store — mutation
Authentication: Required
Purpose: Create the `users` row for the current identity if it doesn't exist (called once after sign-in). Returns the user ID. Idempotent.
Args: none
Returns: `Id<"users">`

### users.me — query
Authentication: Optional (returns `null` when signed out)
Returns:
```ts
{ _id: Id<"users"> } | null   // null when signed out or not stored yet; profile data comes from Clerk on the device
```

### users.deleteAccount — mutation
Authentication: Required (`UNAUTHENTICATED` when signed out)
Args: none
Purpose: Delete all of the caller's `userPaints` (tombstones included) and their `users` row. The Clerk account is deleted afterwards by the client with `user.delete()` (DECISIONS 037).
Behavior:
- No `users` row for the caller → returns `null` without changes, so a retry after a failed Clerk step is safe
- Deletes up to `DELETE_BATCH` (500) `userPaints` rows, then the `users` row. If a full batch was deleted, the internal mutation `users.deletePaints({ userId })` continues in scheduled batches until none are left
Returns: `null`

### userPaints.listMine — query
Authentication: Required (returns `[]` when signed out, so the UI doesn't error)
Args: none
Bounded: at most 5,000 rows (a user has at most one per catalog paint).
Returns:
```ts
Array<{ paintId: string; owned: boolean; wishlisted: boolean; favorite: boolean; updatedAt: number }>
// favorite is false for rows saved before favorites existed
```

### userPaints.set — mutation
Authentication: Required
Args:
```ts
{
  paintId: string;
  owned?: boolean;        // omit to leave unchanged
  wishlisted?: boolean;   // omit to leave unchanged
  favorite?: boolean;     // omit to leave unchanged (DECISIONS 033)
  clientUpdatedAt: number; // ms timestamp of when the user made the change (may be in the past if queued offline)
}
```
Behavior:
- Look up the row via `by_userId_and_paintId`
- Errors: `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `INVALID_PAINT_ID`, `NO_FLAGS`, `CLOCK_IN_FUTURE` (as `ConvexError` data)
- If the row exists and `row.updatedAt > clientUpdatedAt` → ignore (a newer change already won; last-write-wins)
- Otherwise apply the provided flags and set `updatedAt = clientUpdatedAt`
- If no row exists → insert (missing flags default to `false`)
- If all three flags end up `false` → keep the row with every flag `false` (a tombstone), so its `updatedAt` still beats an older queued change (DECISIONS 035). Never deletes
- Idempotent: replaying the same call has no further effect
Validation:
- `paintId` matches `^[a-z0-9-]{3,100}$`
- At least one of `owned` / `wishlisted` / `favorite` is provided
- `clientUpdatedAt` is not more than 5 minutes in the future (clock-skew guard)
Returns: `null`

---

## 2b. Offline Outbox (client)

Every Own/Want/Favorite change goes through the outbox, online or not (DECISIONS 010, 036). Code: `src/features/collection/` (`outbox.ts` pure logic, `device-store.ts` storage, `collection-provider.tsx` wiring).
- One IndexedDB record (`idb-keyval`, key `grimify-device`): `{ userId, rows?, outbox }`. `userId` is the Clerk user ID; `rows` is the last `listMine` answer; `outbox` holds one `{ paintId, owned?, wishlisted?, favorite?, clientUpdatedAt }` entry per paint
- A change to a paint already queued merges into its entry: later flags win, the newer `clientUpdatedAt` is kept
- The screen shows the live `listMine` answer, or the stored `rows` for the same user, with the outbox applied on top. There is no Convex optimistic update
- Flush: when Convex is authenticated and `users.me` is non-null; after each change, when that becomes true, and on the browser's `online` event. Oldest first, one at a time; an entry is removed only after `set` succeeds, and only if the paint wasn't changed again meanwhile
- `INVALID_PAINT_ID`, `NO_FLAGS`, `CLOCK_IN_FUTURE` → drop the entry (the toggle reverts) and toast "Couldn't save that change." Any other error keeps the entry and stops the flush until the next trigger
- Device user: Clerk's user when Clerk has loaded; the stored `userId` while it hasn't (offline launch). Clerk signed out hides the collection and keeps the record; a different user signing in clears it
- The header shows "1 change waiting to sync" / "n changes waiting to sync" while the outbox isn't empty
- Sign out clears the record; with pending changes it asks first

## 3. Error Format

Convex functions throw `ConvexError` with a structured payload:
```ts
throw new ConvexError({ code: "UNAUTHENTICATED", message: "Sign in to save paints" });
```

| code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | No signed-in user |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | Argument failed validation |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Referenced record doesn't exist |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests (if rate limiting is added) |
| `INTERNAL` | Unexpected error (details are never exposed) |

The client maps `code` to a user-facing message (see ERROR_HANDLING.md when it's written).

## 4. API Rules

- Validate all arguments with Convex validators (`v.*`)
- Authenticate every function that touches user data
- Authorize by deriving `userId` from the auth identity. **Never accept `userId` as an argument.**
- Return consistent `ConvexError` payloads
- Don't expose internal details (stack traces, IDs of other users)
- Queries must use indexes (`withIndex`), never `.filter()` on whole tables
- Keep functions small; shared logic goes in `convex/lib/`
